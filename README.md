# LinkedListSorting
Link list implementation in Java with sorting

Java program that arranges a list of words into separate
lists of anagrams. The input is a text file that contains a list of words, each word on its own line.
The number of words in the input is arbitrary and could be very large.
The program prints to an output file the lists of anagrams in the following way:

• All the words that are anagrams of each other are displayed together on a single line; any
word without any corresponding anagrams is displayed alone on a line.
• The words on each line should be in alphabetic order.
• Lines of words are sorted into ascending alphabetic order according to the first word of a
line.
• Words in a line should be separated by a single space.
For example, this input:
car
dog
bed
stop
god
pots
arc
tops
should yield the output:
arc car
bed
dog god
pots stop tops
Linked lists are used to deal with the arbitrary number of anagrams in a line and use an array
of references to keep track of all the linked lists
